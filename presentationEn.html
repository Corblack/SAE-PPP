                My role in this project was mainly the design of the website, especially the team presentation page. I worked alongside another web developer, Johann. We first sketched out ideas for the website together, then divided the tasks to create the site. Additionally, I contributed to other aspects of the project, such as choosing the event and the program. Therefore, my main contribution was through the creation of the site.
